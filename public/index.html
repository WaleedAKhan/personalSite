      University of Toronto, Mississauga</p>

      <p>My time here taught me the skill of self-learning and gave me a better
      understanding of time management. A specialization in
    information security further opened me to the issues of digital security
  and an awareness of the issue whenever I am writing my own applications. An
  additional Math Major also helped me better appreciate the theoretical side
  of Computer Science.

      <h4>Summer Intern, Fixed Income Team (July-September 2016)</h4>
      <p> Worked with the Fixed Income team to help set up a test environment for
        data being used in Tableau. My work mainly involved pulling data from a MYSQL
        server, and setting up an environment in which variables could be tested for
        quickly and with little knowledge of the backend workings. This exercise was
        part of a larger project being work on at the time, whose ultimate goal was
        to allow for better counter-party management.</p>

        <p> This role dealt with technical support for Scotia's main trade floor,
          and called for a broad understanding of all the technologies being used in
          that environment, both software and hardware.
          This role helped refine my problem solving
          and trouble shooting skills and gave me a good taste of what it meant to
           work in a time constrained environment.

      <h4>Lab Teaching Assistant (September-December 2016)</h4>
      <p> During my last year in Undergraduate I was lucky enough to get an opportunity to be
        a Lab Teaching Assistant. I was responsible for running a lab section for
        CSCC108, Introduction to Computer Programming. This role allowed me to
        get familiar with the basics of Python once again and reminded me of why I enjoy it
        as a programming language.
        <p>Getting a chance to assist students new to programming
        forced me to relearn some of the inner workings of the language that are often
        overlooked once a familiarty with it is formed.
